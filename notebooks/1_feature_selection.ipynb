    "In order to predict whether a person will be hospitalized, our main focus is to gather all the features related to their health status. To achieve this, we extensively search the documentation of the database [link] to identify and extract the relevant information. By analyzing these health-related features, we aim to build a predictive model that can effectively assess the likelihood of hospitalization for individuals. The database documentation serves as a valuable resource, providing comprehensive insights into the available variables and their significance in determining hospitalization outcomes. This thorough exploration allows us to capture the necessary data to develop a robust and accurate predictive model for hospitalization prediction."

    "Given the current situation where we have 85 features that need to be reduced to 50 or fewer, we face the challenge of dealing with multiple columns that reference the same concept but are expressed differently. In such cases, we have decided to eliminate columns based on their correlation with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify and eliminate correlated columns, we employ various techniques such as computing the correlation matrix and applying a threshold to determine the maximum allowable correlation between columns. By setting a threshold value, we can remove one of the correlated columns while retaining the most informative one.\n",

    "After realizing that it was possible to eliminate columns in this manner, bearing in mind that the dropped columns may vary depending on the order in which they are considered for removal, we decided to implement a heuristic approach to further refine the feature selection process. This heuristic aims to identify and remove columns with similar meanings or predictive power.\n",

For instance, we can use techniques such as clustering, natural language processing (NLP), or statistical measures to identify groups of columns that share similar patterns or represent similar concepts.\n",

    "To perform feature selection and save the selected columns based on their predictive power, we followed a multi-step process. Firstly, we generated different random states of the data to ensure variability in our analysis. This was achieved by employing techniques like k-fold cross-validation or train-test splits with different random seeds. These random states represent different partitions of the dataset, enabling us to evaluate the stability and robustness of our feature selection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we shuffled the columns within each random state. By randomly reordering the columns, we aimed to eliminate any potential bias or ordering effects that might exist in the original dataset. This step ensured that our analysis focused solely on the relevance and predictive power of the features, independent of their initial order.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the shuffled variables in place, we proceeded to train our model on each random state and evaluate its performance using the area under the curve (AUC) metric. Specifically, we aimed for an AUC threshold of 90 or higher as an indicator of strong predictive capability. If a particular model achieved an AUC of 90 or higher, we considered it to have excellent performance and proceeded to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a model reached or surpassed the desired AUC threshold, we stored the names of all the columns used in a text file. This file served as a record of the selected features that demonstrated significant predictive power for hospitalization outcomes. We ensured to provide a specific path for saving this file, making it easily accessible for future reference, analysis, or model retraining.\n",

    "By following this systematic approach, we leveraged different random states, shuffled the columns, and assessed model performance to identify the most influential features. This process allowed us to select and save the columns that exhibited a high degree of predictive power, ensuring that our subsequent modeling efforts are based on the most informative and impactful set of features.\n",

    "It is important to note that this process assumes prior model training and focuses specifically on feature selection based on predictive performance. Additionally, the AUC threshold can be adjusted based on the specific requirements and objectives of the project."
